\arguments{
\item{years}{Integer. Number of time steps/synchronous reproductive events}

\item{n_females}{Integer. Starting number of breeding females}

\item{afr}{Integer. Age at first reproduction}

\item{p_breed}{Probability that a female breeds, must be between 0 and 1. Can be sex-specific if entered as a vector of length 2 (female,male).}

\item{fecundity}{Mean number of juveniles a female produces each year.}

\item{fixed_fecundity}{Logical. is fecundity fixed or drawn from a Poisson distribution}

\item{p_polyandry}{Probability that a female has any polyandry. Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{p_sire}{Probability that 'social' male sires all offspring. Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{p_retain}{Probability that social partnership is retained. Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{juv_surv}{survival of juveniles until local recruitment, where recruitment is defined as having genetic offspring. Must be between 0 and 1. Can be sex-specific if entered as a vector of length 2 (female,male).}

\item{adult_surv}{survival of adults across years. Must be between 0 and 1. Can be sex-specific if entered as a vector of length 2 (female,male).}

\item{immigration}{Yearly immigration, as a proportion of starting number of females (n_females). Must be between 0 and 1. Can be sex-specific if entered as a vector of length 2 (female,male).}

\item{constant_pop}{Logical. Should there be stochastic variation in population size}

\item{known_age_structure}{Currently not in use}

\item{verbose}{Logical - print simulation progress? useful for debugging}
