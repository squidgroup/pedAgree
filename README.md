# pedAgree
(soon-to-be) R package for pedigree simulations

## Installation

```
devtools::install_github("squidgroup/pedAgree")
library(pedAgree)
```

## Use

Just one function exported at the moment `simulate_pedigree()`. This takes a bunch of parameters (many can be sex specific), to generate stochastic pedigrees via individual based simulations
